# Project Report: Fashion Hub Website MERN Project

## Introduction
The Clothing Website MERN Project aims to develop a comprehensive e-commerce platform focusing on clothing items. This project utilizes the MERN stack, consisting of MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. The primary objective is to create a user-friendly, scalable, and efficient website for browsing, purchasing, and managing clothing products.

## Project Objectives
1. Develop a user authentication system for secure access to the website.
2. Enable users to add products to their shopping carts.
3. Implement an admin panel for managing products, orders, and user accounts.
4. Ensure responsive design for optimal user experience across devices.

## Technologies Used
- MongoDB: A NoSQL database for storing product information, user data, and session details.
- Express.js: A web application framework for building robust APIs and handling server-side logic.
- React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, providing dynamic and interactive components.
- Node.js: A server-side runtime environment for executing JavaScript code.
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens): For implementing authentication and session management.
- Stripe: A payment processing platform for handling online transactions securely.

## Project Features
### User Authentication
- User registration and login functionalities.
- Secure password hashing and storage.
- JWT-based authentication for protected routes.

### Product Catalog
- Display of clothing products with details like name, price, description, and images.

### Shopping Cart
- Addition and removal of products to/from the cart.
- Quantity adjustment and subtotal calculation.
- Clearing the cart or proceeding to checkout.

### Admin Panel
- Product management functionalities (add, edit, delete products).
- User management (view, update user details, roles).

### Responsive Design
- Adaptation of the website layout and design for various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).

## Project Workflow
1. Planning: Defined project requirements, wireframes, and user stories.
2. Backend Development: Implemented server-side logic using Node.js and Express.js, including database setup, API endpoints, and authentication.
3. Frontend Development: Created interactive user interfaces using React.js and integrated with backend APIs.
4. Testing: Conducted unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end testing to ensure functionality and reliability.
5. Deployment: Deployed the application on a hosting platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS) with appropriate configurations for production use.
6. Maintenance: Regular monitoring, bug fixes, and updates to ensure optimal performance and user satisfaction.

## Conclusion
The Clothing Website MERN Project demonstrates the capabilities of the MERN stack in developing a feature-rich e-commerce platform. With its user-friendly interface, robust backend architecture, and seamless integration of essential functionalities, the project aims to provide a satisfying shopping experience for users while offering convenient management tools for administrators. Future enhancements may include additional features such as user reviews, wishlists, and social media integration to further enhance the user experience and expand the platform's capabilities.

## Running Instructions
### Running Frontend (React.js)
1. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Navigate to the frontend directory of your project in the terminal.
   - Run `npm install` to install all the required dependencies listed in the `package.json` file.
2. **Configure Environment Variables:**
   - Create a `.env` file in the frontend directory.
   - Define necessary environment variables such as API endpoints, Stripe keys, etc.
     ```bash
     REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
     REACT_APP_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=your_stripe_public_key
     ```
3. **Run the Development Server:**
   - After installing dependencies and configuring environment variables, run `npm start`.
   - This command will start the development server and launch the frontend application in your default web browser.

### Running Backend (Node.js with Express)
1. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Navigate to the backend directory of your project in the terminal.
   - Run `npm install` to install all the required dependencies listed in the `package.json` file.
2. **Configure Environment Variables:**
   - Create a `.env` file in the backend directory.
   - Define necessary environment variables such as MongoDB connection URI, JWT secret key, etc.
3. **Run the Server:**
   - After installing dependencies and configuring environment variables, run `node index.js`.
   - This command will start the Node.js server, and it will be listening for requests on the specified port (default is 5000).

### Admin Panel
1. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Navigate to the backend directory of your project in the terminal.
   - Run `npm install` to install all the required dependencies listed in the `package.json` file.
2. **Configure Environment Variables:**
   - Create a `.env` file in the backend directory if you haven't already.
   - Define necessary environment variables such as MongoDB connection URI, JWT secret key, etc.
3. **Run the Server:**
   - After installing dependencies and configuring environment variables, run `npm run dev`.
   - This command will start the Node.js server, and it will be listening for requests on the specified port (default is 5000).
